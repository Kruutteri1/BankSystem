Title: Banking System Web Application

Description:
The Banking System web application is a robust and secure financial management platform developed using Spring, Spring Security, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, and more. 
This application enables users to manage their finances efficiently through a user-friendly web interface. 
It incorporates a relational database to store user account details and transaction data. 
Users can register for new accounts and securely log in, leveraging the power of Spring Security.

Key Features:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can register for new accounts by providing their personal details, and the application securely stores this information in a database. 
Spring Security ensures the authentication process is reliable and secure.

2. Interactive Web Interface: The application offers an intuitive web interface that allows users to perform various financial operations. 
The user interface is designed using HTML and Thymeleaf templates, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

3. Database Integration: The system employs a relational database to store user account information and transaction records. 
Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions, making it easy to manage and retrieve data.

4. Error Handling: Exception handlers are implemented to gracefully handle errors that may occur during user interactions. 
For instance, if a user account is not found, the application responds with a JSON message indicating that the user was not found, ensuring a smooth user experience.

5. Add Money (Deposit): Users can add funds to their accounts using the "Add Money" feature. 
They provide the source account and the amount to deposit, and the system securely processes the transaction, updating the account balance accordingly.

6. Transfer Funds: The "Transfer" feature allows users to transfer money from one account to another. 
Users specify the source and destination accounts, along with the transfer amount. The system validates the transaction and ensures that the transfer is reflected accurately in both accounts.

The Banking System web application provides a comprehensive and secure platform for users to manage their finances. 
With its user-friendly interface and robust security measures, users can confidently perform banking operations online. 
Whether it's registering for a new account, making deposits, or transferring funds, this application simplifies financial management while prioritizing data security.
